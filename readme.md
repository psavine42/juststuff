## encoding constraints:

1) Bayesnet
2) 


SOAS

Rinde and Dahl [23]



Algo Types: 
the type of procedural floor plan generation. The types are               Boundaryused, BoundaryRequired
    subdivision,        1               1
    tile placement      1               0
    inside out          0               0
    room growth.        1               0



Misc Techinques:

Seeding.
    given a tiling - where to start each room?
    -constraints -> fn * noise -> seeds
    -Particles moving about (force directed)
    -greedy - largest room first
    - most constrained thing first (by dof)

Operators:
    swap spaces
    slide wall
    break+slide
    reset

Domain:
    meshgrid
    irregular tiling
    continuous bounded


## Constraints

- Overlapping: It describes how space is required or not to be interlocked with another.
- Accessibility: It describes if spaces are connected by means of circulation paths.
- Proximity: it describes the connection between the spaces and distances in between.
- Skin Constraint: It describes if spaces are forced by outline and setback from skin.
- Orientation Constraints: It describes if space should be rotated to face another.
- Prohibit Intersection Constraint
- Build Cost Constraint

## 
Tile-based methods - it should be possible to understand their practical effectiveness by measuring IRL designs to answer - how regular is their wall-grid? 

Wall-grids will probably tend to have fractal-y structure
